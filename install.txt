==============
Video Resizing
==============
By default, video resizing is disabled (key="video.resize" value="false" in picasawebsync.exe.config) but to enable it you should 
install a command-line utility that can handle video resizing and specify the command-line in the video.resize.command config value in
picasawebsync.exe.config.  I highly recommend installing and utilizing FFmpeg (http://www.ffmpeg.org/) for video resizing.  Make sure the 
video.resize.command setting contains the path to the ffmpeg executable or your PATH environment include the directory where this executable
resizes so that PicasaWebSync can locate it at runtime.
